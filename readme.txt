A plugin to add scripts to the beginning and/or the end of the 'content' of any post or page. 

== Description ==

A minimalistic plugin that lets you add scripts to any page or post.
The scripts will be added to the beginning and/or end of the 'content' of the page/post.

A very easy way to add for example Google Adwords conversion tracking code to a page.
And with the new feature, you can also use it to add the Google Website Optimizer code and splittest your landingpages.

== Installation ==

1. There are two ways to install the plugin:
   a) Use the 'automatic install from the Wordpress plugin directory' option in the
      Wordpress New widgets admin panel
   OR
   b) Download the zip-file, and use the 'upload' option in the Wordpress New widgets
      admin panel
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Now you're ready to go! Go to a post or page, open the edit screen, and on the right should appear a 'Scripts to be inserted ' box. All you have to do is insert the scripts you want to add to the beginning and/or the end of the body of the page or post.
